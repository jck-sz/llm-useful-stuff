This repo contains useful prompts for responsible LLM use

I created a set of prompts that align with the latest MIT research on the effects of LLM use on human cognition. The study found that while AI tools like ChatGPT can boost productivity, they come with a hidden cost - what researchers call "cognitive debt." People who rely heavily on LLMs show weaker neural connectivity, can't remember their own work, and struggle when the AI is removed.
These prompts are designed to prevent that cognitive dependency by putting human thinking first and restricting AI from doing our thinking for us. Instead of getting instant answers, the AI is forced to ask probing questions about your goals, wait for your input etc, and only provide technical assistance after you've done some thinking on your own.

The anti_lobotomy_prompt.md is a large file that can be used as a system prompt for your agents.
The gpt-personalize.md and gpt-userinfo.md can be copy pasted into the personalization fields in ChatGPT if you use it.

The whole approach is based on the research finding that the most cognitively healthy AI interaction follows a "Brain-to-LLM" pattern - where humans do the initial thinking and then use AI for enhancement, rather than the other way around. It's designed to make you a better independent thinker while still leveraging AI's capabilities for research, editing, and technical implementation. I believe that this kind of approach will yield you the best long-term results, rather than giving you some quick wins at the cost of your neural connections count.

Essentially, these prompts turn your AI assistant into a cognitive trainer rather than a cognitive crutch, helping you build intellectual muscle instead of creating dependency.
